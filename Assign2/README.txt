I submit two versions of the assignment 2. Because if I do not split the channels, it will just give me a black and white image. But if I split it and merge them, I will get a extremely colorful output. I think they are all right. So, I push them both in the repository.

Steps to run.
1. cmake .
2. make
3. ./assign21 [high-pass image] [low-pass image]
   ./assign22 [high-pass image] [low-pass image]
